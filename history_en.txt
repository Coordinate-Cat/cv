Programming learning service(Start up)
A service that allows users to buy and sell programming learning content without the need for environment development. I was mainly responsible for static coding of all administration and user screens, validation of payment screens, and implementation of component UI using Atomic Design. I also introduced and implemented unit tests using Jest almost entirely on my own.It was a great project that I was assigned to as a new graduate and it gave me a lot of experience.
